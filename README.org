#+TITLE: Create a web frontend with shadow-cljs, Replicant and shadow-css.

Just clone this project template and adjust the parameters as you need. There is nothing dynamic about this template, just a few static files.

*Don't forget to set the the libraries to their newest versions!*

This also depends on the existence of the [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/shadow-cljs][shadow-cljs]] cli tool somwhere in your =PATH= or project.
